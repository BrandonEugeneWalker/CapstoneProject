West Georgia Entertainment Library

The West Georgia Entertainment Library strives to provide easy access to books, video, and music for people of all ages and lifestyles.

Our website provides a way for people who may not be able to go to a public library by other means
to borrow different types of media for consumption and then return it through mail.

Our employee system allows WGEL to keep our product pages up to date and tidy.
